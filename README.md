# FileManager

The purpose of this work was to create a package of programs for encryption and decryption of text and graphic information, since the issue of information protection is quite important nowadays. Having processed a significant amount of theoretical and methodological material devoted to cryptological methods of information transformation, the Security package was created. It consists of several programs, the main one of which is the Security program. It is designed to work with files for further encryption using symmetric cryptological encryption methods. Also, other programs of the package are called directly from it.
To install this package, a corresponding installer ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18406724/210258160-27d1ae0d-081c-4596-b43e-63d5a97f8b1a.png) was developed, which is located on the disk together with the program.
